horn_controller
 
This is the code that runs on the Teensy in the finished product. It reads the values of the buttons and sensors and maps them to Ableton.


button_solder_test

This code tests if the buttons are working and blinks the LED on the Teensy board if they are.


Ableton_Mapping

This code is what I used to individually map all of my parameters in Ableton. Each note had to be mapped one at a time, and the note value would have to be changed in the code every time to match the one being mapped. I mapped between notes 7 and 15.
